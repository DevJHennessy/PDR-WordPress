<h1>Portland Dog Runner WordPress Site</h1>

<p>The site is now <a href="https://portlanddogrunner.com/" target="_blank">live</a>. Check it out, play around with the responsiveness from phone, to tablet, to desktop.</p>

<p>Above are some photos of the homepage for a website I'm designing for a local PDX company, Portland Dog Runner, using WordPress. I've added these mockups since the implementation isn't live yet. I created a child theme using the free theme Sydney. Design of this site included photo manipulation in Photoshop to change the pink color of the logo. Many of the changes for the child theme include CSS modifications to keep the color scheme cohesive. Other changes include making the logo and navigation sticky for mobile devices and large screens, so that it is always present in accordance with current UX best practices. I also changed the hamburger icon to display as an X when the navigation is active/expanded. Another significant change includes moving the photo element from center on small screens to float right on medium (tablet) and large (desktop) screen.</p>
