<h1>Portland Dog Runner WordPress Site</h1>

<p>Here are some photos of the homepage for a website I'm designing for a local PDX company, Portland Dog Runner, using WordPress. I've added these mockups since the implementation isn't live yet. I created a child theme using the free theme Sydney. Design of this site included photo manipulation in Photoshop to change the color of the logo pink. Many of the changes for the child theme include CSS modifications to keep the color scheme cohesive. Other changes include making the logo and navigation sticky for mobile devices, so that it is always present for current UX best practices. Another significant change includes moving the photo element from center small screens to float right on medium (tablet) and large (desktop) screen.</p>
